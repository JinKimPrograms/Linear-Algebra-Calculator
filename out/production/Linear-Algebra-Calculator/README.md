# Linear-Algebra-Calculator

Work-in-progress. An exercise to practice Java programming skills (and OOJ) and brush up on linear algebra concepts. The first usable version will likely be a Java application with a command-line interface that supports entering of vectors & matrices, along with doing basic calculations (checking orthogonality, adding/subtracting, multiplying, etc)
